        "1. What is Simple Linear Regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "Simple Linear Regression (SLR) is a statistical technique used to model and analyze the relationship between one independent variable (X) and one dependent variable (Y). The goal of simple linear regression is to find a straight-line equation that best describes how changes in X affect Y. This relationship is expressed using the equation Y = mX + c, where m is the slope of the line and c is the intercept.\n",
        "\n",
        "Simple linear regression assumes that the relationship between X and Y is linear, meaning that changes in X lead to proportional changes in Y. It is widely used in prediction, forecasting, and understanding trends in data. For example, it can be used to predict marks based on hours studied or sales based on advertising spend.\n",
        "\n",
        "The regression line is determined using the least squares method, which minimizes the difference between actual values and predicted values. Simple linear regression helps quantify the strength and direction of relationships and provides a foundation for more advanced regression techniques.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What are the key assumptions of Simple Linear Regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "Simple Linear Regression relies on several key assumptions to ensure valid and reliable results. The first assumption is linearity, which means that the relationship between the independent variable (X) and dependent variable (Y) must be linear. Second is independence of errors, meaning residuals should not be correlated with each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "The third assumption is homoscedasticity, which means the variance of errors remains constant across all values of X. If this assumption is violated, predictions may become inefficient. The fourth assumption is normality of errors, where residuals should follow a normal distribution, especially important for hypothesis testing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lastly, there should be no significant outliers, as extreme values can strongly influence the regression line. If these assumptions are violated, the regression model may produce biased or misleading results. Therefore, diagnostic plots such as residual plots and Q-Q plots are commonly used to verify these assumptions before interpreting the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What does the coefficient m represent in the equation Y = mX + c?\n",
        "\n",
        "In the regression equation Y = mX + c, the coefficient m represents the slope of the regression line. It indicates the rate of change in the dependent variable (Y) for a one-unit increase in the independent variable (X). In simpler terms, it tells us how much Y increases or decreases when X changes by one unit.\n",
        "\n",
        "If m is positive, it means there is a positive relationship between X and Y—when X increases, Y also increases. If m is negative, it indicates an inverse relationship—Y decreases as X increases. If m is zero, it means there is no linear relationship between X and Y.\n",
        "\n",
        "The slope is extremely important for prediction and interpretation. For example, if m = 5, it means Y increases by 5 units for every 1-unit increase in X. The value of m is estimated using historical data and the least squares method.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What does the intercept c represent in the equation Y = mX + c?\n",
        "\n",
        "The intercept c in the equation Y = mX + c represents the value of the dependent variable (Y) when the independent variable (X) is equal to zero. It is the point where the regression line crosses the Y-axis.\n",
        "\n",
        "The intercept provides a baseline or starting point for the relationship between X and Y. In some real-world scenarios, the intercept has a meaningful interpretation, such as fixed costs when production is zero. However, in other cases, X = 0 may not be practically meaningful, and the intercept mainly helps position the regression line correctly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Even when the intercept does not have a direct real-world interpretation, it is essential for accurate predictions. Removing or misinterpreting the intercept can distort the slope and lead to incorrect conclusions. Thus, the intercept plays a crucial role in defining the regression model mathematically and contextually.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. How do we calculate the slope m in Simple Linear Regression?\n",
        "\n",

        "This method ensures that the regression line minimizes the sum of squared differences between observed and predicted Y values. The slope calculated using this approach represents the best linear fit according to the least squares principle.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is the purpose of the least squares method in Simple Linear Regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "The least squares method is used to determine the best-fitting regression line in Simple Linear Regression. Its main purpose is to minimize the sum of the squared differences between the observed values of the dependent variable (Y) and the values predicted by the regression line. These differences are known as residuals or errors. By squaring the residuals, the method ensures that both positive and negative errors contribute equally and that larger errors are penalized more heavily.\n",
        "\n",
        "This method provides a systematic and objective way to estimate the slope (m) and intercept (c) of the regression equation Y = mX + c. The resulting line is the one that best represents the overall trend in the data. Least squares estimation also has strong statistical properties, such as producing unbiased and efficient estimates under standard regression assumptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Because of its mathematical simplicity and reliability, the least squares method is widely used in statistics, machine learning, economics, and engineering. It forms the foundation of not only simple linear regression but also multiple and polynomial regression models.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How is the coefficient of determination (R²) interpreted in Simple Linear Regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "The coefficient of determination, denoted as R², measures how well the regression model explains the variability of the dependent variable. In Simple Linear Regression, R² represents the proportion of total variation in Y that is explained by X. Its value ranges between 0 and 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "An R² value of 0 means that the independent variable explains none of the variation in the dependent variable, while an R² value of 1 means that it explains all the variation perfectly. For example, an R² of 0.75 indicates that 75% of the variability in Y is explained by X, and the remaining 25% is due to other factors or random error.\n",
        "\n",
        "R² is useful for evaluating the goodness of fit of a regression model, but it should not be used alone. A high R² does not guarantee causation or that the model is appropriate. It is always important to analyze residuals and assumptions alongside R².\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is Multiple Linear Regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between one dependent variable and two or more independent variables. It extends Simple Linear Regression by allowing multiple predictors to explain variations in the dependent variable. The general equation of MLR is:\n",

        "Each coefficient represents the effect of its corresponding independent variable while holding all other variables constant. Multiple Linear Regression is widely used in economics, social sciences, business analytics, and machine learning to make predictions and understand complex relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "MLR allows for more realistic modeling of real-world situations, where outcomes are influenced by several factors simultaneously. However, it also introduces additional assumptions and complexities, such as multicollinearity and interaction effects, which must be carefully handled for accurate results.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is the main difference between Simple and Multiple Linear Regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "The primary difference between Simple Linear Regression (SLR) and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) lies in the number of independent variables used. Simple Linear Regression involves only one independent variable, while Multiple Linear Regression involves two or more independent variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "SLR is easier to interpret and visualize because it represents a straight line in a two-dimensional space. In contrast, MLR represents a multidimensional plane or hyperplane, making visualization and interpretation more complex. Multiple Linear Regression allows analysts to understand the individual impact of several predictors on the dependent variable simultaneously.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, MLR requires stronger assumptions, including the absence of multicollinearity among predictors. While SLR is often used for introductory analysis and simple predictions, MLR is more powerful and suitable for real-world problems where multiple factors influence outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are the key assumptions of Multiple Linear Regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "Multiple Linear Regression relies on several key assumptions. First is linearity, meaning the relationship between predictors and the dependent variable is linear. Second is independence of errors, ensuring residuals are not correlated. Third is homoscedasticity, which requires constant variance of residuals across all levels of predictors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another critical assumption is normality of residuals, particularly important for hypothesis testing. Additionally, MLR assumes no multicollinearity, meaning independent variables should not be highly correlated with each other. High multicollinearity can distort coefficient estimates and reduce model interpretability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Violating these assumptions can lead to biased, inefficient, or misleading results. Therefore, diagnostic checks such as variance inflation factors (VIF), residual plots, and normality tests are essential when working with MLR models.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is heteroscedasticity, and how does it affect Multiple Linear Regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "Heteroscedasticity occurs when the variance of residuals is not constant across levels of the independent variables. Instead of having evenly spread errors, the residuals may increase or decrease systematically. This violates a key assumption of Multiple Linear Regression.\n",
        "\n",
        "While heteroscedasticity does not bias coefficient estimates, it makes standard errors unreliable. As a result, hypothesis tests, confidence intervals, and p-values may become invalid. This can lead to incorrect conclusions about the significance of predictors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Heteroscedasticity is commonly detected using residual plots or formal tests such as the Breusch-Pagan test. To address it, analysts may use data transformations, weighted least squares, or robust standard errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How can you improve a Multiple Linear Regression model with high multicollinearity?\n",
        "\n",
        "High multicollinearity occurs when independent variables are strongly correlated with each other. This makes coefficient estimates unstable and difficult to interpret. One common way to detect multicollinearity is using the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF).\n",
        "\n",
        "To improve the model, redundant variables can be removed or combined. Dimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can also be used. Regularization methods like Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression are effective solutions, as they penalize large coefficients and reduce variance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Addressing multicollinearity improves model stability, interpretability, and predictive performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What are common techniques for transforming categorical variables for regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "Categorical variables must be converted into numerical form before being used in regression models. The most common technique is dummy variable encoding, where categories are represented using binary values (0 or 1). One category is usually dropped to avoid the dummy variable trap.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another method is one-hot encoding, which creates a new column for each category. For ordinal variables, label encoding may be used if the categories have a natural order.\n",
        "\n",
        "Proper encoding allows regression models to incorporate qualitative information while maintaining mathematical validity.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is the role of interaction terms in Multiple Linear Regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "Interaction terms capture situations where the effect of one independent variable on the dependent variable depends on the value of another variable. They are created by multiplying two predictors together.\n",
        "\n",
        "Including interaction terms allows the model to represent more complex relationships. For example, the impact of education on income may depend on work experience. Without interaction terms, such relationships would be missed.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, interaction terms increase model complexity and should be included only when theoretically justified.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. How can the interpretation of intercept differ between Simple and Multiple Linear Regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "In Simple Linear Regression, the intercept represents the expected value of Y when X equals zero. In Multiple Linear Regression, the intercept represents the value of Y when all independent variables equal zero.\n",
        "\n",
        "This interpretation may be unrealistic in many real-world cases, especially when zero values are not meaningful. Nevertheless, the intercept is essential for positioning the regression plane correctly and ensuring accurate predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is the significance of the slope in regression analysis?\n",
        "\n",
        "The slope represents the expected change in the dependent variable for a one-unit increase in an independent variable, holding other variables constant. It indicates both the direction and strength of the relationship.\n",
        "\n",
        "A statistically significant slope suggests a meaningful relationship between variables. Slopes are crucial for prediction, policy analysis, and decision-making.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What are the limitations of using R² as the sole performance measure?\n",
        "\n",
        "R² increases whenever more predictors are added, even if they are irrelevant. It does not indicate causality or model correctness. A high R² can still result in poor predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Adjusted R², residual analysis, and cross-validation should be used alongside R² for reliable evaluation.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. How would you interpret a large standard error for a regression coefficient?\n",
        "\n",
        "A large standard error indicates uncertainty in the coefficient estimate. It suggests that the variable may not be statistically significant or that the model suffers from issues such as multicollinearity or small sample size.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What is polynomial regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "Polynomial regression is a form of regression where the relationship between the independent variable and dependent variable is modeled as an nth-degree polynomial. It allows nonlinear relationships while still using linear regression techniques.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. When is polynomial regression used?\n",
        "\n",
        "Polynomial regression is used when data shows curvature that cannot be captured by a straight line. It is useful for modeling growth trends and nonlinear patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. How does the intercept provide context in regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "The intercept serves as a baseline reference point, indicating the expected outcome when predictors are zero. It helps contextualize the regression equation.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. How is heteroscedasticity identified using residual plots?\n",
        "\n",
        "Heteroscedasticity appears as a funnel or pattern in residual plots. Addressing it is important to ensure valid statistical inference.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. What does high R² but low adjusted R² indicate?\n",
        "\n",
        "It indicates that unnecessary predictors are included, inflating R² without improving true explanatory power.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. Why is scaling important in Multiple Linear Regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "Scaling ensures variables contribute equally, improves numerical stability, and is essential for regularized models.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. How does polynomial regression differ from linear regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "Linear regression fits straight lines, while polynomial regression fits curved relationships using polynomial terms.\n",
