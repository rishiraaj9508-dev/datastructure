        "Q1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "Interpreted languages execute code line by line using an interpreter, while compiled languages convert the entire program into machine code before execution. Python is an interpreted language, which makes debugging easier and development faster. Compiled languages like C or C++ generally execute faster because the code is already translated. Interpreted languages are more flexible and platform-independent, while compiled languages offer better performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "Exception handling in Python is a mechanism to handle runtime errors so that the program does not crash unexpectedly. It allows the programmer to catch errors using try and except blocks and handle them gracefully. This improves program reliability and user experience. Common exceptions include ZeroDivisionError, FileNotFoundError, and ValueError.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "The finally block is used to execute code regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. It is commonly used for cleanup operations such as closing files or releasing resources. Even if an exception is raised or handled, the code inside finally always runs, ensuring important tasks are completed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        "Logging in Python is used to record messages that describe program execution. It helps in debugging, monitoring, and maintaining applications. The logging module allows messages to be categorized into levels like INFO, WARNING, and ERROR. Logs can be written to files or displayed on the console, making error tracking easier.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "The __del__ method is a destructor that is called when an object is about to be destroyed. It is mainly used to release external resources such as files or network connections. Python uses automatic garbage collection, so explicit destructors are rarely required, but __del__ can help in cleanup tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q6. What is the difference between import and from … import in Python?\n",
        "The import statement imports the entire module and accesses its contents using the module name. The from … import statement imports specific functions or variables directly. Using from … import makes code shorter, but import avoids name conflicts and improves code clarity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "Multiple exceptions can be handled using multiple except blocks or a single except block with multiple exception types. This allows different handling for different errors. It improves error management by responding appropriately to each exception type instead of treating all errors the same.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q8. What is the purpose of the with statement in file handling?\n",
        "The with statement simplifies file handling by automatically closing the file after use. It manages resources efficiently and prevents memory leaks. Even if an exception occurs, the file is closed properly. This makes code cleaner, safer, and more readable compared to manual file closing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "Multithreading uses multiple threads within the same process and shares memory, making it lightweight. Multiprocessing uses multiple processes with separate memory spaces, avoiding Global Interpreter Lock issues. Multithreading is suitable for I/O-bound tasks, while multiprocessing is better for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        "Logging helps track program flow and errors without interrupting execution. It is useful for debugging and monitoring applications in production. Logs can be stored in files for future analysis. Unlike print statements, logging supports severity levels and flexible output control.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "Memory management in Python refers to how memory is allocated, used, and released during program execution. Python automatically manages memory using a private heap and garbage collection. Developers do not need to manually allocate or free memory, which reduces errors like memory leaks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "The basic steps include placing risky code inside a try block, catching errors using except, executing optional code in else if no exception occurs, and running cleanup code in finally. This structured approach ensures errors are handled gracefully.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "Memory management is important to ensure efficient use of system resources. Poor memory handling can lead to slow performance or crashes. Python’s automatic memory management reduces developer burden, but understanding it helps write optimized and reliable programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "The try block contains code that may cause an error. The except block catches and handles the exception. This prevents abrupt program termination and allows custom error handling. It improves program stability and user experience.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "Python uses reference counting and a cyclic garbage collector. When an object’s reference count becomes zero, memory is freed. The garbage collector also detects cyclic references. This automatic system ensures unused memory is reclaimed efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "The else block executes only if no exception occurs in the try block. It is used to separate normal execution code from error-handling code. This improves code readability and structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        "Common logging levels are DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL. DEBUG provides detailed information, INFO shows general messages, WARNING indicates potential issues, ERROR logs serious problems, and CRITICAL logs severe errors causing program failure.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q18. Difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing?\n",
        "os.fork() creates a child process by duplicating the current process and is Unix-specific. The multiprocessing module is cross-platform and provides higher-level APIs. Multiprocessing is safer and more portable for creating parallel processes in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "Closing a file releases system resources and ensures data is properly written. If files are not closed, it may lead to memory leaks or data corruption. Using with automatically handles file closing safely.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q20. Difference between file.read() and file.readline()?\n",
        "file.read() reads the entire file content at once, while file.readline() reads one line at a time. Reading line by line is memory-efficient for large files. read() is suitable for small files.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q21. What is the logging module used for?\n",
        "The logging module is used to record runtime information, warnings, and errors. It helps in debugging and monitoring applications. Logs can be stored persistently in files with different severity levels.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q22. What is the os module used for in file handling?\n",
        "The os module provides functions to interact with the operating system. It is used to check file existence, create directories, remove files, and manage paths. It helps make file handling more flexible and system-aware.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q23. What are the challenges in memory management in Python?\n",
        "Challenges include handling large objects, memory leaks from circular references, and inefficient data structures. Although Python manages memory automatically, poor coding practices can still cause high memory usage and performance issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
        "Exceptions can be raised manually using the raise keyword. This is useful for enforcing conditions or custom error handling. Developers can raise built-in or user-defined exceptions to signal errors clearly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q25. Why is multithreading important in some applications?\n",
        "Multithreading improves responsiveness and efficiency in I/O-bound applications. It allows tasks like file reading and network operations to run concurrently. This enhances performance and user experience in applications like servers and GUI programs."
