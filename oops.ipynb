        "THEORY QUESTIONS\n",
        "\n",
        "Q1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming approach that organizes code using objects and classes. It focuses on representing real-world entities as objects that contain data (attributes) and behavior (methods). OOP improves code reusability, modularity, and readability. It is based on principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. Python supports OOP, making programs easier to maintain and extend.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "A class is a blueprint or template used to create objects in Object-Oriented Programming. It defines the properties (variables) and behaviors (methods) that the objects will have. A class does not occupy memory until an object is created from it. For example, a class Car can define attributes like color and speed, and methods like start() and stop().\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity and occupies memory. Objects access the variables and methods defined inside the class. For example, if Car is a class, then my_car can be an object of that class. Each object can have different values for the same attributes defined in the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "Abstraction hides unnecessary details and shows only essential features of an object. It focuses on what an object does. Encapsulation, on the other hand, binds data and methods together and restricts direct access to data. Abstraction is achieved using abstract classes and interfaces, while encapsulation is implemented using access modifiers and private variables in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "Dunder methods are special methods in Python that begin and end with double underscores, such as __init__ and __str__. They are also called magic methods. These methods allow customization of class behavior. For example, __init__ initializes objects, and __str__ defines how an object is displayed when printed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "Inheritance allows one class to acquire the properties and methods of another class. The existing class is called the parent or base class, and the new class is called the child or derived class. Inheritance promotes code reuse and reduces redundancy. Python supports single, multiple, and multilevel inheritance using parentheses while defining classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "Polymorphism means “many forms.” It allows the same method name to behave differently based on the object calling it. In Python, polymorphism is achieved through method overriding and operator overloading. It improves flexibility and code readability. For example, different classes can have the same method name draw() with different implementations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "Encapsulation in Python is achieved by restricting access to class variables and methods. This is done using naming conventions such as single underscore _ for protected members and double underscore __ for private members. Getter and setter methods are used to access and modify private data safely, ensuring data security and controlled access.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "A constructor is a special method used to initialize objects when they are created. In Python, the constructor is named __init__. It is automatically called when an object is instantiated. Constructors are used to assign initial values to object attributes and perform setup tasks required for the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "Class methods operate on class variables and use the @classmethod decorator. They take cls as the first parameter. Static methods do not use instance or class variables and use the @staticmethod decorator. They behave like regular functions but belong to a class for logical grouping.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "Method overloading means defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. Python does not support traditional method overloading like Java. However, it can be achieved using default arguments or variable-length arguments. This allows a method to behave differently based on the number or type of arguments passed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "Method overriding occurs when a child class provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in the parent class. The method name and parameters must be the same. It is used to modify or extend the behavior of inherited methods. Python supports method overriding naturally through inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "The @property decorator allows a method to be accessed like an attribute. It is used to implement getter methods in a clean way. Property decorators improve encapsulation by controlling access to private variables while keeping syntax simple. They help make code more readable and maintainable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated uniformly. It improves flexibility and scalability of programs. With polymorphism, the same interface can be used for different data types. This reduces code duplication and makes programs easier to extend and maintain, especially in large applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and is used as a blueprint for other classes. It contains abstract methods that must be implemented by derived classes. Abstract classes are created using the abc module in Python. They enforce a standard structure for child classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "OOP provides modularity, code reusability, and better organization. It makes programs easier to understand, maintain, and debug. Concepts like inheritance and polymorphism reduce code duplication. Encapsulation improves data security, while abstraction hides complexity, making OOP suitable for large and complex software systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q17. Difference between class variable and instance variable?\n",
        "A class variable is shared among all objects of a class, while an instance variable is unique to each object. Class variables are defined inside the class but outside methods. Instance variables are defined inside the constructor using self. Changing a class variable affects all objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class. This enables a child class to access attributes and methods from multiple base classes. Python supports multiple inheritance and resolves conflicts using the Method Resolution Order (MRO).\n",
        "\n",
        "Q19. Purpose of __str__ and __repr__ methods?\n",
        "The __str__ method defines a human-readable string representation of an object, used by print(). The __repr__ method provides an official representation useful for debugging. If __str__ is not defined, Python uses __repr__ by default.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q20. Significance of super() function in Python?\n",
        "The super() function is used to call methods of a parent class from a child class. It helps avoid code duplication and supports method resolution in multiple inheritance. Using super() makes code more maintainable and ensures correct parent method execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q21. Significance of __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "The __del__ method is a destructor that is called when an object is destroyed. It is used to release resources like files or database connections. Python automatically manages memory, so explicit use of __del__ is rare but useful in cleanup operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q22. Difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod?\n",
        "A static method does not access class or instance data and has no special first parameter. A class method accesses class variables and takes cls as the first parameter. Static methods are utility functions, while class methods modify or access class-level data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q23. How does polymorphism work with inheritance in Python?\n",
        "In inheritance, polymorphism works by method overriding. A child class can redefine a method of the parent class. When the method is called using a parent reference, Python decides at runtime which method to execute based on the object type.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "Method chaining is calling multiple methods on the same object in a single line. Each method returns the object itself using self. It improves code readability and allows fluent programming style. Method chaining is commonly used in builder patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q25. Purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "The __call__ method allows an object to be called like a function. When an object is called using parentheses, this method executes. It is useful for creating callable objects and implementing function-like behavior within classes."
